<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Step One:</h1>
<h2>The first step to being able to take a pan shot is to have the proper gear. 
    Obviously nicer cameras and lenses can assist in the ease of hitting the shot, 
    but a pan can be hit with most cameras, even some phones! The only real requirement is 
    that the camera needs to be able to shoot in a manual mode. This simply means that your able to manipulate
    the shutter speed, iso, and aperture. Lenses aren't as important, but a telephoto (zoom) lense would be the best for most situations.

<h4>As shown below you can still take photos with a wide-angle, but it is much trickier.</h4>

<h1>Step Two:</h1>   
<h2>The second step is to understand how and why we take panning photos. Pans are used to showcase motion. 
    Unlike a normal photo which freezes action, a pan shows the subject in motion, and the background a smooth blur. 
    To achieve this blur we manipulate the shutter speed. By lowering the shutter speed, we increase the amount of time the shutter stays open, thus taking in more information, and allowing motion to become present. 
</h2>
<center>
    <h4>  For example: Below are two seperate images, one is a still while the other is a pan. The still was shot with the shutter speed 1/1000. The pan was shot with a speed of 1/20.</h4>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="tutorialphotos\stillexample.jpg" alt="still" style="width:40%">
          <h4>As you can see, in the still image the background is still sharp and in focus. <br>You can see the detail in the road and the kerb!</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="tutorialphotos\pan example.jpg" alt="pan" style="width:40%">
         <h4>With the Pan, you can almost makeout the grandstands in the background,<br> but they are blurry. While the car is sharp!</h4>
        </div>
      </div> 
</center>
<h1> Step 3:</h1>
<h3>
    Continuing with the theme of camera settings, there is no exact number for the shutter speed when it comes to pans. 
    A common rule of thumb is to have the shutter speed under 1/60, however depending on the speed of your subject you can get away with a higher shutter speed.
    At certain spots of the track, I might be shooting at 1/100 if the cars are going very fast, or all the way down to 1/10 at slower parts. The best advice
    I could give would be to test out different shutter speeds until you get results you are happy with!
    Setting your ISO and Aperture are less relevant, but still important. Depending on lighting you might need to raise or lower either.
    If it's dark out, you'd want to lower your aperture to let more light in, and raise ISO for the same reason. However if it's bright out, you'd want to do the opposite
    and raise the aperture and lower the ISO.

<h4>
    For example: below are two shots taken at different times of the day and different lighting situations.
</h4>
<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <img src="ptlmphoto\ptlm31.jpg" alt="dark" style="width:60%">
      <h4>Due to it being night time, the shutter speed and aperture were really low to allow more light to come in. And the ISO was around 1600 to also increase the brightness.</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <img src="daytonaphoto\daytona11.jpg" alt="light" style="width:60%">
     <h4>In this situation, it was very bright at Daytona so I lowered <br>the ISO and raised the Aperture to not have the shot too bright. </h4>
    </div>
  </div> 

</center>
 <h1> Step 4:
 </h1>
 <h3>
    Finally the last step is the technic. It sounds fairly straight forward, but in practice is the hardest part. 
    To hit a pan, you have to follow the subject as smoothly as possible, allowing it to stay in the same part of your viewfinder!
     For example, with cars I try to keep the side mirrors in the same part of the viewfinder. Generally I keep it dead center, but sometimes I like to stagger it for a more unique shot!
     The key is to start the motion before you plan to take the shot, and continue the motion after as well. It helps keep the shot smooth!

        <div class="column">
          <img src="ptlmphoto\ptlm11.jpg" alt="rexy" style="width:60%">
          <h4>In this example you can see the side mirror perfectly centered in the frame!</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="ptlmphoto\ptlm33.jpg" alt="Corvette" style="width:60%">
         <h4>Unlike the previous photo, I off centered the car to show it better through the leaves and trees! </h4>
